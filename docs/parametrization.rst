Prior distributions in FlowNet
===========================================

The different parameters to be tuned are defined in the FlowNet config yaml.
Here, the choices available for the following parameters will be explained in more detail :ref:`porosity and pore volume<porosity-and-pore-volume>`

* Aquifers_
* Equilibration_ parameters
* Faults_
* Permeabilities_
* 
  

All parameters needs an initial guess on what values they can take. 
This is referred to as the prior probability distribution.

There are several different prior distributions or data types defined for ERT. 
The following ones are available in Flownet:

:Normal distribution: The normal distribution is defined by the mean value and the standard deviation

:Log-normal distribution: The log-normal distribution in defined by the mean value and the standard deviation


.. _Aquifers:
.. _Equilibration:
.. _Faults:
.. _Permeabilities:
.. _porosity-and-pore-volume:
