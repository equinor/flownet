About FlowNet
**************************

Development on FlowNet originally started in 2018 as a digitalisation effort in Equinor that aimed at creating
data-driven reservoir predictions. In line with Equinor's core values 'open' and 'collaborative'
the internal development was quickly open-sourced.

If you would like to collaborate with us we encourage you to fork this repository and start contributing
and sharing together with us.

FlowNet today has contributions from the following industry and research partners:
